Email Verification Tool in Golang
Install Dependencies:

To verify MX records, we will use the standard net package.

Code Explanation
Syntax Check: Uses a regular expression (regexp) to check if the email follows the standard format (e.g. user@domain.com).

MX Domain Check: Uses net.LookupMX to check the domain's MX records, which indicate whether the domain is configured to receive email.

verifyEmail Function: Combines syntax and domain checks to determine if the email is valid.

Running the Code
Save the code to a file, for example, email_verifier.go.

Compile and run:
go build -o email_verifier email_verifier.go
./email_verifier

Testing with Multiple Emails
You can add or remove emails from the email list in code to test different cases.

Possible Improvements
Full Validation with SMTP: For deeper checks, such as verifying that an email address actually exists, you could use the SMTP protocol to try to establish a connection to the email server. However, this is more complex and may be blocked by some email servers.
Error Handling: Improve error and message handling to cover more specific cases.
Command Line Interface: Add a CLI interface to pass emails as arguments or read from a file.
